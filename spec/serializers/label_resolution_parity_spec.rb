# A conversation stores its labels as tags — plain strings. Turning a tag back
# into a Label row (id + title + colour) is what every read path needs, and each
# one writes that resolution itself today. The copies have already drifted apart
# once in a way only the screen could see, so these examples pin the semantics
# instead of leaving it to convention:
#
#   * title matches case-insensitively
#   * id matches exactly, because Postgres renders uuid lower-case
#   * a tag matching no label is dropped
#   * a label tagged twice (once by title, once by id) is one chip, not two
#
# Every example asserts the REST payload and the realtime payload land on the
# same chips for the same tags. That agreement is the contract; which path
# computes it is an implementation detail that may be consolidated freely.
