# EVO-2204: PipelinePolicy was permission-only, so the visibility model
# (private / public / team, plus is_default and creator) was enforced only in
# #index. Every direct-ID action resolved the pipeline with a bare find and never
# consulted visibility, letting any user holding pipelines.* reach another user's
# private pipeline (horizontal privilege escalation).
#
# These specs pin the fix: the record-level policy rules (and the child
# controllers that authorize through them) now AND the permission with the same
# Scope#resolve that filters the list, so detail and list can never disagree.
# Permissions are stubbed true throughout to isolate the visibility dimension.
