# Conformance guard: every permission key wired into a controller through
# require_permission(s) must exist in the auth RBAC catalog. The per-controller
# *_rbac_spec files stub check_user_permission against literal lists, so an
# off-catalog key (a typo, or an action the auth service never defined) would
# pass those specs yet deny every real user at runtime. This spec reflects over
# the concern's registry of declared keys and asserts each is a valid catalog
# key, using the in-repo catalog mirror as the notion of the catalog (the SSOT
# lives in the sibling auth repo). When that sibling is checked out alongside
# this repo, the mirror is additionally cross-checked against it for drift.
