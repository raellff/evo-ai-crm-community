# Executes automation-rule actions for contact-triggered events
# (`contact_created` / `contact_updated`) that have no conversation in scope.

# Only a subset of actions can run without a conversation: webhooks and
# contact-level labels operate directly on the contact. Conversation-bound
# actions (send_message, assign_team, assign_agent, pipeline moves, status
# changes, …) cannot run here. Instead of silently doing nothing — the previous
# behaviour of `AutomationRuleListener#execute_contact_actions`, which only
# handled `send_webhook_event` and left everything else as a no-op — they are
# recorded on the run as `skipped` with a reason, so the outcome is observable
# in the automation logs (`automation_rule_runs`).

  # they take the contact branch. `send_webhook_event` stays local because the
