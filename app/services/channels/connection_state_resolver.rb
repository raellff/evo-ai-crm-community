# frozen_string_literal: true

# Resolves a channel's live connection state for the /inboxes payload
# (EVO-1674). This module is the single source-of-truth map per channel type:
#
#   Whatsapp (hub-managed)             -> provider_config.evolution_hub.status
#   Whatsapp (QR providers)            -> provider_connection['connection']
#   Whatsapp (token providers)         -> recorded credential probe, else unknown
#                                         (a rejected probe is error; evidence
#                                          expires where a job renews it)
#   Email                              -> configured == assumed connected
#   Sendgrid                           -> webhook_registration_status
#   FacebookPage / Instagram (hub)     -> evolution_hub_meta['status']
#   FacebookPage / Instagram (classic) -> unknown (no health signal exists)
#   everything else                    -> unknown (no health signal exists)
#
# `source` tells the client where the answer came from: 'provider_event'
# (webhook/event-fed), 'stored_flag' (read off what we stored about the
# channel), or 'none' (channel type has no health support — degrade explicitly
# in the UI).
